                      Janumet 50 mg/500 mg Tablet is a combination of two medicines that control high blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This helps prevent serious complications of diabetes such as kidney damage and blindness and may reduce your chances of having a heart attack or stroke.<br><br>
                  
                      Janumet 50 mg/500 mg Tablet may be prescribed alone or along with other diabetes medications. It works best when used along with a healthy diet and regular exercise. The dose you are given will depend on your condition, blood sugar levels, and what other medicines you are taking. Taking it with meals helps to reduce the chances of developing an upset stomach.<br><br>
                      
                      You should take it regularly, at the same time each day, to get the most benefit and you should not stop unless your doctor recommends it. It is important to stay on the diet and exercise program recommended by your doctor while taking this medicine. Your lifestyle plays a big part in controlling diabetes.<br><br>
                      
                      The most common side effects of taking Janumet 50 mg/500 mg Tablet include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, headache, and sore throat. Low blood sugar level (hypoglycemia) is a possible side effect if you are also taking other diabetes medicines like insulin or sulfonylurea, so you need to know how to recognize and deal with it.<br><br>
                      
                      This medicine is not suitable for everyone.

                      50 mg/500 mg Tablet so tell your doctor about all the other medicines you are taking to make sure you are safe. You should try to avoid drinking alcohol as it lowers blood glucose. Your doctor will 
                      check your kidney function and blood sugar levels before and during treatment.

                      Istamet 50mg/500mg Tablet is a combination of two medicines that control high blood sugar levels in people with 
                      type 2 diabetes mellitus. This helps prevent serious complications of diabetes such as kidney damage and blindness 
                      and may reduce your chances of having a heart attack or stroke.
                  
                      Istamet 50mg/500mg Tablet may be prescribed alone or along with other diabetes medications. It works best when used 
                      along with a healthy diet and regular exercise. The dose you are given will depend on your condition, blood sugar levels, 
                      and what other medicines you are taking. Taking it with meals helps to reduce the chances of developing an upset stomach.
                      
                      You should take it regularly, at the same time each day, to get the most benefit and you should not stop unless your doctor 
                      recommends it. It is important to stay on the diet and exercise program recommended by your doctor while taking this medicine. 
                      Your lifestyle plays a big part in controlling diabetes.

                      and sore throat. Low blood sugar level (hypoglycemia) is a possible side effect if you are also taking other diabetes medicines 
                      like insulin or sulfonylurea, so you need to know how to recognize and deal with it.
